          <h1> Overview
          </h1>
          <h3> The creation of this app allowed me to apply my new skills in the UX Design Process. This is not a case study for a completely refined app, but rather a project that helped me gain more experience, especially with the early research
            focused stages of the design process.

        <div>
          <h2> Why Wordier?
          </h2>
          <h3> I designed the Wordier app as part of my UX course at Careerfoundry. The goal was to create a vocabulary-learning or flashcard application.
          </h3>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2> My Role
          </h2>
          <h3> As the sole designer for this app, I was responsible for all phases of the design process, including Generative User Research, Persona Creation, User Flows, Wireframing, Prototyping, and Usability Testing.
          </h3>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2> Summary
          </h2>
          <h3> This case study outlines the process that I took to create a vocabulary-learning app for mobile devices. I was the sole designer and it took less than 1 month to complete.
          </h3>
          <h3> Tools I Used: Prott, Skype, Google Drawings, Pen and Paper
          </h3>

        <div class="wordierdisclosure">

            <h2> Usability Testing
            </h2>
            <h3> With a functioning low fidelity prototype, I began conducting usability testing. Users were sent the link to my prototype and asked to complete a series of tasks while we communicated via Skype. I instructed the users to "think out
              loud" while working through the tasks in an effort to gather as much information as possible regarding what they liked, disliked, and what tasks were challenging. All users were asked the same questions in order to keep the information
              consistent.
            </h3>
            <h3> I compiled the results of the testing and created the following Usability Test Report.

            <h2> Conclusion
            </h2>
            <h3> Thank you for taking the time to read my brief case study of the Wordier App. I learned a lot about the fundamentals of the User Experience Design Process, and while this project did not continue onto high-fidelity wireframeing, it
              was an effective learning experience which covered stages of the design process crucial to achieving a great user experience.
